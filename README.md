# 10x_2nd_analysis_shinyapp
  		The repository contains all the require files to build a docker-based shiny app implementing the 
    Bioconductor workflow of the 2nd analysis on droplet-based scRNASeq count data (e.g. 10X, link: 
    https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/simpleSingleCell/inst/doc/work-3-tenx.html#overview). 
      A docker image can be built either locally or on a EC2 instance where Docker has been installed. 
    The suggested system requirement is 8Gb RAM, 8-16Gb HD.
